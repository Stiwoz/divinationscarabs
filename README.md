## Adjusting prices:
To adjust prices, adjust one or the other of the files included in the data folder.
Either adjust the price listed in `cards.json`, or add an overriding price in `overrides.json`

## Maintaining the project:
You can make a pull request, and I'll almost certainly approve it. By 3.25, I'd like to go back over the code and clean things up, but not for now.
This scarab might also get changed.
